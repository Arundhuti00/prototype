Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br>
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;<br>
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br>
The work of hunters is another thing:<br>
I have come after them and made repair<br>
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,<br>
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br>
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br>
No one has seen them made or heard them made,<br>
But at spring mending-time we find them there.<br>
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>
And on a day we meet to walk the line<br>
And set the wall between us once again.<br>
We keep the wall between us as we go.<br>
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br>
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls<br>
We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br>
‘Stay where you are until our backs are turned!’<br>
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br>
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,<br>
One on a side. It comes to little more:<br>
There where it is we do not need the wall:<br>
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br>
My apple trees will never get across<br>
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br>
He only says, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’<br>
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br>
If I could put a notion in his head:<br>
‘Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it<br>
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br>
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know<br>
What I was walling in or walling out,<br>
And to whom I was like to give offense.<br>
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
That wants it down.’ I could say ‘Elves’ to him,<br>
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather<br>
He said it for himself. I see him there<br>
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br>
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br>
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br>
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.<br>
He will not go behind his father's saying,<br>
And he likes having thought of it so well<br>
He says again, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.’<br>

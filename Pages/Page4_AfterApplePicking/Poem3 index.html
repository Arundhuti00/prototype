         <br><br><br>
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree<br>
Toward heaven still,<br>
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill<br>
Beside it, and there may be two or three<br>
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.<br>
But I am done with apple-picking now.<br>
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,<br>
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.<br>
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight<br>
I got from looking through a pane of glass<br>
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough<br>
And held against the world of hoary grass.<br>
It melted, and I let it fall and break.<br>
But I was well<br>
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,<br>
And I could tell<br>
What form my dreaming was about to take.<br>
Magnified apples appear and disappear,<br>
Stem end and blossom end,<br>
And every fleck of russet showing clear.<br>
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,<br>
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.<br>
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.<br>
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin<br>
The rumbling sound<br>
Of load on load of apples coming in.<br>
For I have had too much<br>
Of apple-picking: I am overtired<br>
Of the great harvest I myself desired.<br>
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,<br>
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.<br>
For all<br>
That struck the earth,<br>
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,<br>
Went surely to the cider-apple heap<br>
As of no worth.<br>
One can see what will trouble<br>
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.<br>
Were he not gone,<br>
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his<br>
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,<br>
Or just some human sleep.<br>
         </p></div></div>
